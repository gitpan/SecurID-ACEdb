First, edit Makefile.PL to change the LIBS and INC, which specify the
location of the ACE Administrative API libraries and include
files. These files are typically found in the examples subdirectory
under the top-level ACE/Server installation. You must also modify the
macro field and change the DLC variable, which specifies where the RDBMS
libraries are kept.

You should be able to install by running these commands:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

Before you can test this package, you will need to have write access to
the ACE databases, because some of the tests require creating and
destroying bogus users. Even if the tests did not modify any databases
the API always opens the databases in read/write mode. The test script
will ask you for the serial number of an unused token for doing the user 
modification tests. If you want to skip these tests, enter the word NONE 
in place of the serial number.
