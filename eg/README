This directory contains three useful scripts

activity

  Lists all activity associated with a user's token. Takes one mandatory
  parameter (the userid of the user in question), and one optional
  parameter (the number of days of activity to list). This parameter
  defaults to one day.

clrnext

  Takes a token out of "Next Pin Mode". This is useful at our site where
  all authentication transactions are stateless (done via dialup and
  RADIUS), and the client is not able to respond to and enter a second
  PIN. It takes a single parameter: the userid whose token is in next
  PIN mode.

tokeninf

  Takes a userid as a parameter, and displays all information about that 
  user's token.
